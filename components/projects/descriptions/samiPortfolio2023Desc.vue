            This project refines my 2022 portfolio, showcasing the harmonious use of Vue.js and Nuxt.js on GitHub. 
            It emphasizes clean code, organized files, and modern design with a personal touch. Additionally, 
            I implemented smooth animated transitions for enhanced user experience during page changes and rendering.
