        <p class="mt-1 text-lg">
            In a 2-person team, we built a JavaScript application on Replit. This bot lets Discord users request data from a Replit database using specific commands. 
            The project aimed to create a hub for our WoW community's profession-related data. 
            We tracked recipe acquisition in the Discord server through the "learn" command, enhancing community communication and crafting collaboration.
