        <p class="mt-1 text-lg">Project Image Gallery is an individually made web based application created with JavaScript. 
            This project focused heavily on understanding HTML5 and CSS concepts in conjunction with JavaScript and Express.js. 
            Features such as logging in and out, post, search, and commenting were implemented to reinforce the basics of constructing a website with front and back end.
