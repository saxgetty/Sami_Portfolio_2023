            I developed the Image Gallery as a solo web-based application using JavaScript. 
            This project revolved around mastering HTML5 and CSS concepts combined with JavaScript and Express.js. 
            The project encompassed crucial website construction skills, integrating features like login/logout, posting, searching, and commenting. 
            This comprehensive implementation reinforced both front-end and back-end fundamentals.
