      I developed the Image Gallery as a solo web-based application using
      JavaScript. This project revolved around mastering HTML5 and CSS concepts
      combined with JavaScript and Express.js. The project encompassed crucial
      website construction skills, integrating features like login/logout,
      posting, searching, and commenting. This comprehensive implementation
      reinforced both front-end and back-end fundamentals.
