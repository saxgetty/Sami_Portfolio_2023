            As part of a 4-person team, we developed iTinerary, an iOS mobile app using XCode. Swift language, UI Kit, and SwiftUI frameworks were our tools. 
            iTinerary acts as a trip planning and note-taking app. In my role, I integrated key APIs from Apple and Google Places for our mapping feature. 
            I contributed to design layout, collaborated on checklist and schedule components, and crafted our logo and feature icons using Procreate.
