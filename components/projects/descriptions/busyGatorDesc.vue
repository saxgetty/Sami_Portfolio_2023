            Project BusyGator involved developing a mock e-commerce site for San Francisco State University. 
            I led a team of 7 developers, managing tasks, deadlines, and communication. 
            As Team Lead, I focused on project management, while as a Team Member, I handled tasks such as SQL database design, milestone documentation, logo creation, and adding finishing touches.
