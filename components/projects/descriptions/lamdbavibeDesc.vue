            Collaborating as a team of 4, we crafted LambdaVibe, a web-based music player and visualizer. 
            Leveraging the Tone.js package, users interact by clicking instruments to generate and play notes. 
            Alongside, a compact song database offers playability and searchability, with searches possible by either song name or artist.
