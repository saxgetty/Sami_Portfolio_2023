      I developed Tank Wars using Java, employing the model-view-controller
      design pattern. This project fully embraced object-oriented programming's
      three pillars. It facilitated two-player interactions along with
      environment engagement through keyboard controls. The aim was simple:
      eliminate opponents by shooting until one player's lives depleted.
