            I developed Tank Wars using Java, employing the model-view-controller design pattern. 
            This project fully embraced object-oriented programming's three pillars. 
            It facilitated two-player interactions along with environment engagement through keyboard controls. 
            The aim was simple: eliminate opponents by shooting until one player's lives depleted.
