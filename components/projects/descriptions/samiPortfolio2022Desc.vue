        <p class="mt-1 text-lg">This project was the first personal portfolio I created after freshly graduating from college. 
            Throughout this project I furthered my knowledge in React.js and also learned a new design framework named Material UI.
            Since this was my first portfolio I prioritized implementing my own style over matching current design techniques to allow my creativity to flow. 
            I also focused on functionality over anything since this was a learning opportunity for me.
