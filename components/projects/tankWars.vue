        <p class="mt-1 text-lg">Project Tank Wars is an individually made Java based application using the model view controller design archetype. 
            This project was built utilizing all 3 pillars of object oriented programming and allowed two players to interact with each other and their surroundings using the keyboard. 
            The objective is to shoot each other down until one players lives run out.
