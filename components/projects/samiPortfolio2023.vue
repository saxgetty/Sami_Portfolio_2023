        <p class="mt-1 text-lg">This project is in continuous development as a new iteration of my first portofilio from 2022. During this project I learned two new frameworks, Vue.js and Nuxt.js. I prioritized
            clean code, concise file organization, and smooth overall integration to GitHub. For design, I focused on having simplistic and up to date components with a touch of my own personal style.
            Since this project is still in development I plan to add transitions and animations, as well as design updates, and links to upcoming projects I will be working on.</p>
