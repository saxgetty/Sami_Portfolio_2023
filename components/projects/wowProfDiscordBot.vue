        <p class="mt-1 text-lg">Project World of Warcraft (WoW) Professions Discord Bot is an application created with Javascript and Replit in a team of 2. This project allows Discord users to call certain commands in Discord text channels that return existing data within the Replit database. The goal behind this personal project was to provide our WoW community with a hub for all data in the game regarding professions. This allowed us to keep track of all individuals that had specific recipes within the given Discord server once they "learned" it by running the learn command. Using this streamlined community communication and craft sharing.</p>
