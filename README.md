# Sami Saxton-Getty Portfolio 2023

This project refines my 2022 portfolio, showcasing the harmonious use of Vue.js and Nuxt.js on GitHub. It emphasizes clean code, organized files, and modern design with a personal touch. Additionally, I implemented smooth animated transitions for enhanced user experience during page changes and rendering.
